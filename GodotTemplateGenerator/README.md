1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GodotTemplateGenerator.git
   ```
   Or download the ZIP file from the repository page and extract it.

2. **Open the project in Godot**
   - Launch Godot Engine
   - Select "Import" from the Project Manager

   - Select the project file (`project.godot`) and click "Import & Edit"

3. **Explore the project structure**
   - Browse through the `tutorials` folder to access learning materials
   - Check out the `templates` folder for ready-to-use game starting points

## 📚 Tutorial Structure

The tutorials are organized by game type and movement system:

### Movement Systems
- **2D Platform Movement**: Jump, run, and navigate platforms
- **Top-Down Movement**: Move characters from an overhead perspective
- **First-Person Movement**: Navigate 3D environments from a first-person view
- **Point-and-Click Movement**: Click-to-move navigation system

### Game Types
- **Top-Down Shooter**: Create a game with overhead perspective and shooting mechanics
- **2D Platformer**: Build a side-scrolling platform game with jumping and obstacles
- **More templates coming soon!**

Each tutorial includes:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Fully commented code examples with syntax highlighting
- Visual guides and screenshots
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Extension ideas to customize your game

## 🛤️ Learning Path for Beginners

We recommend the following progression for newcomers to Godot:

1. **Start with the basics**: Read through the "Godot Fundamentals" section to understand the engine's core concepts
2. **Choose a movement system**: Follow the tutorial for your preferred movement type
3. **Build a simple game**: Select a game template that matches your interests
4. **Extend and customize**: Once comfortable, try adding new features or combining elements from different tutorials
5. **Share and learn**: Join our community to share your creations and learn from others

## 📂 Code Organization

The project follows a clear organizational structure:

## 🔧 How to Use the Templates

Our templates are designed to be both educational and practical:

1. **Open a template project**: Navigate to the `templates` folder and open your chosen game type
2. **Understand the structure**: Each template includes a `README.md` with specific information about its organization
3. **Run the template**: Press F5 or click the "Play" button to see the template in action
4. **Modify and extend**: Use the corresponding tutorial to understand how to customize the template
5. **Create your game**: Build upon the template by adding your own assets, levels, and mechanics

Each template provides:
- A complete, working game foundation
- Modular code that's easy to understand and modify
- Placeholder assets that you can replace with your own
- Commented code explaining key concepts and design decisions
